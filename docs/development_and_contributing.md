Making Pixelorama more popular is a win-win scenario for everyone, because more people knowing about it means that we will get more feedback, which will be used to make Pixelorama even better, and some people might be interested even in contributing code directly!

## Contributing Code
You are free to open pull-requests to [Pixelorama's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) to fix issues or implement new features. Keep in mind, however, that not all PRs will be merged. Some may need discussion, or others may be downright closed. Make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first.

## Contributing Feedback
Do you have a super cool idea for the development of Pixelorama and want to share it? Then the best way to do it is by opening a [Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/categories/ideas). That is the most effective way for your feedback to be seen and discussed with the team and other developers that are interested in helping.

## Testing and reporting issues
Did Pixelorama crash? Did you find a bug, performance issue, visual glitches or pverall unexpected behavior? If so, feel free to open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues). If you wish to maximize the chances of the issue being addressed, please keep in mind to be as specific as possible and provide as many details as you can. The version of Pixelorama, your operating system, a clear and thorough explanation of the issue and steps to reproduce (if you know them) are a must to include. Otherwise, it will be harder for us to replicate the issue, and thus find the source of the problem. If you want to, including screenshots and videos of you replicating the issue in your issue report is a great help!

## Contributing Documentation
The documentation is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama-Docs). If you wish to contribute, you are free to open pull requests. Make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama-Docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first.

## Contributing Translations
If you wish to contribute a translation, make sure to use [Pixelorama's Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/pixelorama). Crowdin is a web-based translation platform, where people can contribute translations together and with ease.
